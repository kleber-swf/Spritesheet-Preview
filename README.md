SpriteSheet Preview is a simple tool to preview sprite sheets.

## Features

* Easy to use: just drag and drop your sprite sheet, configure the rows and columns and you are good to play.
* Preview your sprite sheet before your assets go to the game.
* Play/pause/loop your animation.
* Ping pong play.
* Control the fps of your animation.
* Configure the animation interval to preview a specific animation inside a sprite map.
* Frames panel to help you to find specific frames.
* Control the background color and transparency.
* Zoom in/zoom out your animation.
* Game Engine/programming language independence: the resultant files work with any game engine or programming language since the engine/language supports open image files (if it not support this, why in the earth you are using it?).
* Works on Windows速 and Mac速 (Adobe速 AIR速 runtime required).
* Automatically keeps you up to date: when a new version is released, you know it the next time you open the program.
